1. RealSense SDK use libjpeg-turbo to decode MJPEG frames from D436. libjpeg-turbo is downloaded and compiled during SDK compilation as 3rd party library.
    a) Please note the Please note the new BUILD_WITH_JPEGTURBO option, it should be turned on to utilize fast JPEG decoding since the new camera hardware output high resolution images in MJPEG format.
    b) On Intel platform, before compile, nasm compiler should be installed and make sure it's in the PATH. This is to enable best performance. For example, on Ubuntu 20.04,
       sudo apt-get install nasm

2. After SDK build completion, check libjpeg-turbo is compiled and installed correctly.
   a) libjpeg-turbo library should be generated under ~/librealsense/build/libjpeg-turbo as part of build process.
      NUC12DCMv9:~/librealsense/build/libjpeg-turbo$ ls -l bin
          cjpeg
          djpeg
          jpegtran
          rdjpgcom
          tjbench
          wrjpgcom

      NUC12DCMv9:~/librealsense/build/libjpeg-turbo$ ls -l lib
          libjpeg.a
          libjpeg.so -> libjpeg.so.62
          libjpeg.so.62 -> libjpeg.so.62.3.0
          libjpeg.so.62.3.0
          libturbojpeg.a
          libturbojpeg.so -> libturbojpeg.so.0
          libturbojpeg.so.0 -> libturbojpeg.so.0.2.0
          libturbojpeg.so.0.2.0

    b) libturbojpeg library files should be updated to /usr/local/lib. If not, please make the libturbojpeg.so* files in /usr/local/lib in sync with build/libjpeg-turbo folder.
       NUC12DCMv9:~/librealsense/build/libjpeg-turbo$ ls -li /usr/local/lib/
       libturbojpeg.so -> libturbojpeg.so.0
       libturbojpeg.so.0 -> libturbojpeg.so.0.2.0
       libturbojpeg.so.0.2.0

3. Run tjbench to check JPEG decoding benchmark performance
   cd ~/librealsense/build/libjpeg-turbo/bin
   ./tjbench ~/librealsense/third-party/libjpeg-turbo/test.jpg -fastdct -fastupsample -rgb -warmup 5 -benchtime 30 -nowrite
     Using fastest DCT/IDCT algorithm
     Using fast upsampling code
     Warmup time = 5.0 seconds
     >>>>>  JPEG 4:2:2 --> RGB (Top-down)  <<<<<
     Image size: 4160 x 3120
     Decompress    --> Frame rate:         33.477898 fps
                       Throughput:         434.516334 Megapixels/sec


4. Check actual decoding performance in SDK
   export LRS_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
   run rs-align with depth alignement and filter but turn off colorizer and rendering

   A log file should appear in the folder, for example, 2022-09-08-10_04_03.log
   Check jpeg conversion performance matric in the log file, for example
   08/09 10:04:14,119 INFO [140293339174464] (color-formats-converter.cpp:710) average jpeg conversion time: 29.280000 ms
   08/09 10:04:24,118 INFO [140293339174464] (color-formats-converter.cpp:710) average jpeg conversion time: 30.460000 ms

5. Performance from step 3 and 4 should be close
